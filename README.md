### My process
First we organized the HTML structure for the mobile design and we added the layouts for both designs.


### Built with
- HTML
- CSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media Query


### What I learned

- How to add a icon to the browser tab.

```
<link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="../scr/images/favicon.png">

```

- How to overlay one image on another with z-index property.

```

html, body{
    position: relative;
}

#topCircle {
    position: absolute;  
    z-index: -1;
}

#component {
    position:absolute;
    z-index: 1;
}

```
